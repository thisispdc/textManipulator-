# textManipulator-
This is a very basic text manipulator which can perform certain actions on the text you provide to it. It isnt a very fancy one as this is my first project in Django.

1. Just close the repository, open with IDE of your choice.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directiry.
3. Run "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal.
4. It gives an ip address which you can open in any browser.

I would love to get feedbacks and suggestions regarding how I can improve this and get to dive deeper with Django!
